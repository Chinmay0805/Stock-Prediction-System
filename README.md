## 📈 **Stock Price Prediction System**  
The **Stock Price Prediction System** is a machine learning model designed to predict future stock prices based on historical data using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks. LSTM models are ideal for time-series data as they capture long-term dependencies and patterns in the data.  

---

## 🚀 **Features**  
✅ Predicts future stock prices based on historical data.  
✅ Uses LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network for sequential data processing.  
✅ Plots predicted vs actual stock prices for better visualization.  
✅ Scalable and adaptable to different stock datasets.

## 🛠️ **Tech Stack**  
| Component | Tool/Library |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Programming Language** | Python |
| **Data Handling** | Pandas, NumPy |
| **Data Visualization** | Matplotlib, Seaborn |
| **Model** | Keras, TensorFlow (LSTM) |
| **Feature Scaling** | MinMaxScaler |
| **Evaluation** | RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) |

## 🌐 **Workflow**  
1. **Data Collection:** Collected historical stock price data.  
2. **Preprocessing:** Scaled data using MinMaxScaler to normalize it.  
3. **Training:** Built an LSTM model to learn patterns from historical data.  
4. **Prediction:** Predicted future stock prices based on past trends.  
5. **Evaluation:** Compared predicted vs actual prices using RMSE and visualization.
